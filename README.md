# GAN-with-MNIST

### A neural network model which generates images based on the mnist dataset

The images that were generated after i ran the code are stored in the folder "gan_images".
You can notice the improvement in image generation as the number in the suffix of the image title increases.

## To run the code your self and generate new sets of images
1. Delete the folder "gan_images"
2. Run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt"
3. Run the command "python gan_using_mnist.py"

After the model is trained it will start to generate the images
