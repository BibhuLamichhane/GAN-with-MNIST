# GAN-with-MNIST

### The image below is a small sample from the mnist training data

### There are two neural networks, the generator and the discriminator. The generator based on the training data tries to create a image. While the discriminator tries to predict if the image was generated by the other neural network. Over multiple iterations the generator gets better at creating the image and the discriminator gets better at predicting if its real or not.

## The following images are the images generated over multiple iterations

### (Note: To view the generated images of other numbers go to <a href="https://github.com/BibhuLamichhane/GAN-with-MNIST/tree/master/gan_images">gan_images</a> folder in this repo. The number before "--" represents the number being generated and the number after "--" represents the iteration)
## To run the code your self and generate new sets of images
1. Delete the folder "gan_images"
2. Run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt"
3. Run the command "python gan_using_mnist.py"

After the model is trained it will start to generate the images
